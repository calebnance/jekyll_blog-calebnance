With Github's recent custom (per repository) Open Graph image support [feature announcement](https://github.blog/2019-04-17-custom-open-graph-images-for-repositories/), I wanted to test it out! Side note, this has been an open [issue since March 2016](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/612).

## Location
Find it on any repo within the **Settings Tab** on Github.

<div class="img-wrapper">
  <img class="img" src="/assets/img/dev/github-social-preview.png" alt="github open graph image support" />
</div>

## Test Preview Image
Once you've uploaded a preview image, test it on Twitter: [Link Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator) or Facebook: [Debug Sharing Link](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/sharing/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcalebnance%2Fexpo-netflix).

<div class="img-wrapper">
  <img class="img" src="/assets/img/dev/twitter-card-validator.png" alt="twitter link validator" />
</div>

## Post the thing
Then once all of that checks out, [post it](https://twitter.com/calebnance/status/1120037834507812865)!
