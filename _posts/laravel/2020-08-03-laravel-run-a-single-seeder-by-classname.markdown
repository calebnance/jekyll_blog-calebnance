Below is how to run a single seeder from your command line:

{% highlight conf %}
php artisan db:seed --class=PokemonCardsPricingTableSeeder
{% endhighlight %}

In the above command, you would need to replace the **--class=** value to what your classname is.

That's it! Short and sweet. Cheers üçª
