Today I wanted to write down a collective list of things you can do on the frontend to save all of the **kb**s (or **mb**s 🤔).

First off, if you have not heard of Google's [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) plugin yet, head on over and [download it](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk). This will help you understand where your website needs improvement.

I will break them down into sections:

* [Images & SVGs](#images-svgs)
* [CSS & Javascript](#css-javascript)
* [Server Side](#server-side)

## Images / SVGs {#images-svgs}

* * *

## CSS & Javascript {#css-javascript}

* * *

## Server Side {#server-side}

* * *

This post was mainly in response to this [Twitter Post](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier/status/1030488369199906816) from [Chris Coyier](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier). I hope it helped!
