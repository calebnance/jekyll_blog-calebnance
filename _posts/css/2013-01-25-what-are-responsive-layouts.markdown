A lot of the talk has been "What are Responsive Layouts?". I have recently really been hearing people talk and ask about them. I have been messing around with the Twitter Bootstrap framework for a good while now. And was really happy to hear that Joomla 3.0 was bringing not only jQuery to the core, but also [Twitter Bootstrap](/css/using-twitter-bootstrap-beginners-part-1.html).

#### What is it?
A responsive layout site is basically a website that is coded for any and every type of screen size. This might be overwhelming to think about but it is a lot easier to do than you think, mainly because of the many different frameworks (code bases) available.

Most of the responsive layouts features are all handled with **CSS**, some a little more with the help of **jQuery** and/or **javascript**.

#### Things To Know About Responsive Layouts
There are three "main" screens it is for, a regular desktop computer screen, a tablet screen (iPad, Kindle), and a mobile device screen (iPhone, Android, etc.).

The framework is built with "default" styles, from button styles to "built in" functions for a tabbing layout. There are a lot of things that come standard on **Twitter Bootstrap**, and it is very easy to implement even some of the more difficult things.

I love one of the slogans that Twitter Bootstrap uses, "By nerds, for nerds"... I may not be the best designer out there, but this stuff looks clean! It really is a great **frontend UI** (user interface) and makes my job a lot easier, I can worry more about the functionality than the layout and look now.
