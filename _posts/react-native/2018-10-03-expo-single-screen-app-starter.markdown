Today I wanted to tell you all about the expo project I created to help you jump start a quick 1 screen app.

This is a perfect project for a game app, or any app idea that only really needs one main screen. I got the idea from a game app actually, [click here](https://github.com/calebnance/expo-single-screen-starter#demo-and-release-notes) to see the side by side of this code repo and the game.

### Out of the box

- Expo SDK Latest
- Airbnb Eslint and Prettier
- Simple Jest testing

This also comes with a very nice **api/constants** import system I've slowly made better and better. This comes with **global colors**, **device info**, and **global styles**. This project is meant to be small and as minimal as possible, but the framework is pretty nice and easily expandable. Pull requests are welcome!
