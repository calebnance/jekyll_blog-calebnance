To continue from my last post, I wanted to share with you a more robust multi screen expo app starter.

<a href="https://github.com/calebnance/expo-multi-screen-starter" class="btn btn-outline-dark">View Project on Github</a>

### Out of the box

- Expo SDK ~~31~~ 32 (will upgrade to latest SDK as released)
- [React Navigation v.3](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/getting-started.html)
- Prettier &amp; Airbnb Eslint
- Simple Jest testing

#### Other notable examples
- Dynamic route transitions (**Mode:** regular & modal)
- SVG usage
- Utility checker for the notch: iPhoneX, iPhoneXs, iPhoneXr, iPhoneXs Max
- Preloading/caching local fonts & images
  - with splash loading screen
  - and once the app has loaded, [lottie](https://airbnb.io/lottie/) animation intro into app
- Navigation Stacks
- Example of Production vs Development flags
- Custom SVG back button within React Navigation header

[Check the Demo & Release Notes here](https://github.com/calebnance/expo-multi-screen-starter#demo-and-release-notes)

This also comes with a very nice **api/constants** import system I've slowly made better and better. This comes with **global colors**, **device info**, and **global styles**. Pull requests are welcome!
